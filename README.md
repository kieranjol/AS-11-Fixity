# AS-11-Fixity

Placeholder just to remind me. Parse md5 element with xmlstarlet, run fixity check on the mxf, produce report if checksums do not match. <br>

Here's how it could work <br>
1. Establish pwd <br>
2. find all xml/mxf <br>
3. store md5 from xml<br>
4. run md5deep on mxf <br>
5. compare the two md5 values<br>
6. create report in terminal and possible in csv format<br>
